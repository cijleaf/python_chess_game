To compile PC chess software from sources:



1. Install all needed software and prepare folders:

Install Inno Setup Compiler 5.5.9 (for final setup package)

Install python 2.7 from official site, then install pygame,
 Then install setup-tools package, in order to use commands
easy_install and pip packages, full instruction here:

http://blog.troygrosfield.com/2010/12/18/installing-easy_install-and-pip-for-python/



Then install pygame, pyinstaller, py2exe by commands:

pip install pygame
pip install pystockfish
pip install pyinstaller
pip install py2exe

( more info about pyinstaller here: http://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html )




Next, extract chess.zip to c:\chess folder and chess_distr.zip to c:\chess_distr.


Open c:\chess\run.py and check value:
TO_EXE = True
It means that main software will launch move.exe and usb.exe files, not Python scripts
It have to be TO_EXE = False for debugging if you run Python scripts directly.



2. Compilation.


cd c:\chess
pyinstaller --icon=c:\chess\certabo.ico run.py

Then copy c:\chess\dist\run\run.exe to c:\chess_distr


if you made changes in usb.py file, also do:

python 1.py py2exe

Then copy c:\chess\dist\usb.exe to c:\chess_distr


if you made changes in move.py file, also do:

pyinstaller move.py

Then copy c:\chess\dist\move\move.exe to c:\chess_distr


3. Executing:

cd c:\chess_distr
run.exe

4. To make setup package, launch Inno Setup Compiler and open file c:\chess\for_inno_setup\inno_script.iss
then select Build>Compile in Menu or press Ctrl+F9. The resulting file will appear in folder c:\tmp
